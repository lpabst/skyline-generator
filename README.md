# Improvement Ideas

- draw the moon more realistically, as well as in different phases/shapes
- include more colors for the buildings.
  - lower levels are more yellow, higher levels are more white in images I've seen
  - some buildings have fancy colors up top in their penthouse suites
- include clouds
- include something on the ground / below the horizon
- include options on the UI for the user to choose what kinds of things they want included (percentages for windows, moon shapes, etc)
- include options for alien skies (multiple moons etc)
