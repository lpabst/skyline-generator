# Improvement Ideas

- draw the moon more realistically, as well as in different phases/shapes
- include more colors for the buildings.
  - lower levels are more yellow, higher levels are more white in images I've seen
  - some buildings have fancy colors up top in their penthouse suites
- include clouds
- include something on the ground / below the horizon
